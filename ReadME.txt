Hello everyone. These are some custom bots I had created for the game "Quake 3 Arena" using existing in game models that did not have attributes or AI assigned to them. If you're still playing the game, i would like to share the bot files with you. 

*****How to install*****
 
Just download the .pk3 file and copy-paste it into the game's "baseq3" folder and you can enjoy the fight/team up with the bots when you play.
